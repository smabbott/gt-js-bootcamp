0.0.0 - an empty html page and somewhere to put js and css
≠ 0.0.1 - seperate js, css, markup is good practice 
0.0.4 - hello world
0.0.5 - debugging things (don't expect anything to work the first time)
      - var foo = 100/0;
      - avoid frustration
      - encourages experimentation and guessing
      - encourage small changes  
      - frequent trial & error
      - better understanding

0.1.0 - select element (old school) ≠ but wrong load order
      ≠ how HTML is parsed
      ≠ load order matters
0.1.1 - other method is by onload event handler
0.1.2 - [detour] what is a function?
      - it is an abstraction
      - variables can have function as value

0.2.0 - what is an event?
      - a class of something that happened
      - a message broadcast to the 
0.2.1 - event bubbling

0.3.0 - scope


Exercise 1 - 











• best practices - seperation of concerns. js => behavior, css => presentation, html => semantic structure
• debugging with the console and console.log()
• load order is important
• events - bubbling
• jquery is convenience. It is an abstraction of frequently used patterns, utilities. Also 
• object-oriented programming - everything is an object with data and behavior
• 
• return - functions always return a value. return undefined if not specified.








Maybe start with object-oriented code, 
build up to robot army
don't worry about anything in the dom yet
