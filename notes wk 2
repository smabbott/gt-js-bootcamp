❤ Review: Object-oriented progmming encapsulates state and behavior. This is good for 
• organization 
• abstraction 
• legibility
• maintainability 
• sanity


❤ Put it into practice: build the Exquisite Robot Army
• given some specs, identify the states and behaviors we should track
• group states and behaviors into objects what they concern






Specs:
• Should be able to choose from a variety of heads, torsos and legs for a robot.
• Should be able to name a robot.
• Should be able to assign a rank to the robot.
• Should be able to enlist the robot to the army.
• Enlisting a robot should show the robot in the recruits list.
• A robot may not be enlisted to the army without having each of the previously listed properties assigned.
• When the robot is enlisted, all fields in the workbench are reset.
• ...and some other things that we'll define later
